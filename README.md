bookfortune
===========

an arduino-powered book fortune teller for libraries and others.

built for use with Adafruit's thermal printer and an arduino uno.


you'll need the Adafruit thermal printer library from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Thermal-Printer-Library

and the Entropy library from http://code.google.com/p/avr-hardware-random-number-generation/

to make this work.
